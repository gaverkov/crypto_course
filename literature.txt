Several people asked me about the literature I would recommend for the course. Here are some recommendations.

RSA:

I've already recommended the chapter on the RSA from the book Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. It gives a self-contained introduction in a lecture-class style. The original 1978 by the inventors (Rivest, Shamir, Adelman) is both short and clearly written.

General cryptopgrahy books:

Those of you who can read German could take a look at the book of W. Willems "Codierungstheorie und Kryptographie". The cryptography part of this book is about 40 pages long. So, it's a short introduction into the topic, but it does not cover DES and the zero-knowledge proofs.

Some longer general books in Engish:

Buchmann, 2004, Introduction to Cryptography. It's a relatively short book (about 300 pages) that covers all the topics of this module.

Delfs, Knebl, 2015, Introduction to Cryptography. This one is longer  (about 500 pages) and covers even more material.

Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman, 2014, An  Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography. This is more than 500 pages long. I like the way elliptic curves are explained in this one (with pictures, the geometric intuition and examples).

Literature on DES: 

I do not know any literature in which one explains why DES is designed the way it is designed (having convincing motivation for design choices is what I am missing), rather than just explaining how it is designed. In some sources, there are a few comments about what properties and this kind of explanation looks like a mysterious cooking recipe for a magical drink.
